This page will help you install and build your first Orionjs project. If you already have Orionjs installed, you can skip this page.

## Requirements {#installation}

- Node: 14 (LTS)

## Installing Orionjs CLI

Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use yarn to install the `orion` command line utility:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="Npm">

```bash
npm install -g @orion-js/core
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @orion-js/core
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using a starter kit

Now that you have the `orion` command you can download a starter kit.

Available kits:

- **typescript-starter**: Contains a basic Orionjs TypeScript starter project.
- **graphql-starter**: Contains a basic Orionjs GraphQL server.
- **http-starter**: Contains a basic Orionjs HTTP server.
- **service-starter**: Contains a basic Orionjs 3.1 Service architecture.

Let's example start with the `typescript-starter` kit. This will create a new project with a already set up TypeScript starter project with GraphQL & HTTP server:

```bash
orion create --kit typescript-starter --name myproject
```

This will create a folder called `myproject`, in the directory where you ran the command

### Alternative

Alternatively, to install the TypeScript starter project with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siturra/boilerplate-orionjs-typescript-starter.git myproject
```

**Hint**: When cloning the repository, it will be cloned with the history in .git

## Install dependencies from starter kit's

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="Npm">

```bash
cd myproject
npm install
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
cd myproject
yarn install
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Running the server

The starter kit comes with a `.env.example` file which you will need to rename to `.env`, this file can receive environment variables and the start command.

```bash title=".env"
PORT=3000
VARIABLE_1="example"
```

### Run

Run the following command to start the server locally

```bash
orion start
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
